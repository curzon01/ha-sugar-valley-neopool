## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- Fixed YAML migration translation map with correct YAML package entity keys:
  - `hydrolysis_data_gh` (not `hydrolysis_data_g_h`)
  - `hydrolysis_runtime_pol_changes` (not `hydrolysis_runtime_polarity_changes`)
  - `hydrolysis_ctrl_fl1_water_flow` → `hydrolysis_water_flow`
  - `hydrolysis_boost_mode` → `boost_mode`
  - `conndiag_*` variants for connection sensors
  - Added identity mappings for `modules_*` keys

### Added

- Added comprehensive debug logging for migration troubleshooting

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- Added missing sensors: `hydrolysis_runtime_pol1`, `hydrolysis_runtime_pol2`, `connection_out_of_range`

### Fixed

- Fixed YAML migration entity ID preservation: added translation map (`YAML_TO_INTEGRATION_KEY_MAP`)
  to bridge naming differences between YAML package and integration entity keys
- Fixed migration verification timing: deferred verification to next HA restart when recorder
  metadata is fully synchronized, preventing false "0 entities with history" reports

## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- Fixed entity migration to preserve original YAML entity IDs during migration
- Fixed device name extraction from migrated entities instead of hardcoding
- Corrected translation placeholders in `yaml_migration_result` config flow step
- Fixed entity registry API usage for entity_id lookup
- Removed unused `platform_domain` argument from entity `__init__` calls
- Fixed entity migration tests for new architecture
- Corrected NodeID assertions in entity tests (TEST123 → ABC123)

### Changed

- Improved test suite reliability with correct mock data and assertions

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Device name configuration in Options flow: users can now customize the device name
- Entity ID regeneration option: checkbox to update entity IDs when device name changes
- DIAGNOSTIC entity category added to connection sensors (requests, responses, no_response)
- **Enhanced YAML migration with history preservation**:
  - Migration now uses DELETE approach to remove old MQTT entities from registry
  - New entities are created with the same `entity_id` to preserve historical data
  - Config flow shows "what will happen" before migration and "what was done" after
  - Persistent notification with final verification assessment after setup completes
  - History verification checks if entities have data older than 1 hour
  - Clear status indicators: ✅ Successful, ⚠️ Partial, ℹ️ No History, ❌ Failed
- **Comprehensive test suite**: Achieved 99% code coverage with extended tests for all modules

### Changed

- `powerunit_nodeid` sensor is now enabled by default (was disabled by default)
- Migration now runs entirely in config flow (before entry creation) for better user feedback
- Updated all 10 translation files with `yaml_migration_result` step

### Fixed

- Fixed blank `yaml_migration_result` step in config flow - migration results now display properly
- Removed all inline `icon=` attributes from entity descriptions - icons now exclusively use `icons.json`
- Fixed test patch targets for recorder history functions

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Active YAML entity detection: config flow now detects existing entities before migration
  and shows a summary step with migration results

### Changed

- Improved config flow: added new `yaml_migration_result` step showing migration summary
  with entity counts and unique_id prefix information

### Fixed

- Fixed test mock for `_find_active_entities` in yaml_confirm flow

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-06

### Changed

- Improved YAML migration entity detection: now finds entities owned by other platforms (e.g., mqtt)
  in addition to orphaned entities
- Renamed internal methods from "orphaned" to "migratable" for clarity
- Updated all 10 translation files with "migratable" terminology

### Fixed

- Fixed entity detection during YAML migration - entities from YAML packages are now correctly found
- Fixed test for migratable entity detection logic

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- **NodeID-based unique IDs**: All entities now use hardware-based NodeID in unique_id pattern
  (`neopool_mqtt_{nodeid}_{entity_key}`)
- **Automatic YAML migration flow**: Guided config flow for migrating from YAML package configuration
  - Checkbox to indicate YAML package migration
  - YAML topic validation with MQTT subscription test
  - Custom topic support (not limited to default "SmartPool")
  - Automatic entity migration with history preservation
- **Automatic Tasmota configuration**: Integration automatically sends `SetOption157 1` to enable NodeID if
  hidden
- **Multi-device support**: NodeID-based identifiers enable stable configuration for multiple NeoPool controllers
- **Powerunit NodeID diagnostic sensor**: Shows the hardware NodeID from the NeoPool controller
- **Comprehensive test suite**: Added tests for all modules achieving 97%+ code coverage

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Unique ID pattern changed from `neopool_mqtt_{key}` to `neopool_mqtt_{nodeid}_{key}`
  - Automatic migration preserves all historical data for YAML package users
  - Manual setup users will get new entities with NodeID-based IDs
- **Tasmota SetOption157**: Changed from `0` (hide NodeID) to `1` (show NodeID) - required for integration
- Device identifiers now use NodeID instead of topic name
- Config entry unique_id now based on NodeID for proper duplicate detection
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows for improved CI/CD
- Enhanced README with recovery script variables documentation

### Fixed

- Multiple instances of the same device no longer create duplicate entities
- Entity unique IDs are now stable across topic name changes
- Fixed release workflow path (was pointing to wrong directory)
- Corrected repository name in README badges and links
