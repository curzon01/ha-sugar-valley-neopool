## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- **NodeID-based unique IDs**: All entities now use hardware-based NodeID in unique_id pattern
  (`neopool_mqtt_{nodeid}_{entity_key}`)
- **Automatic YAML migration flow**: Guided config flow for migrating from YAML package configuration
  - Checkbox to indicate YAML package migration
  - YAML topic validation with MQTT subscription test
  - Custom topic support (not limited to default "SmartPool")
  - Automatic entity migration with history preservation
- **Automatic Tasmota configuration**: Integration automatically sends `SetOption157 1` to enable NodeID if
  hidden
- **Multi-device support**: NodeID-based identifiers enable stable configuration for multiple NeoPool controllers
- **Powerunit NodeID diagnostic sensor**: Shows the hardware NodeID from the NeoPool controller
- **Comprehensive test suite**: Added tests for all modules achieving 97%+ code coverage

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Unique ID pattern changed from `neopool_mqtt_{key}` to `neopool_mqtt_{nodeid}_{key}`
  - Automatic migration preserves all historical data for YAML package users
  - Manual setup users will get new entities with NodeID-based IDs
- **Tasmota SetOption157**: Changed from `0` (hide NodeID) to `1` (show NodeID) - required for integration
- Device identifiers now use NodeID instead of topic name
- Config entry unique_id now based on NodeID for proper duplicate detection
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows for improved CI/CD
- Enhanced README with recovery script variables documentation

### Fixed

- Multiple instances of the same device no longer create duplicate entities
- Entity unique IDs are now stable across topic name changes
- Fixed release workflow path (was pointing to wrong directory)
- Corrected repository name in README badges and links
