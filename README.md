  when device recovers
- **Device triggers**: Automate based on device connection events (offline,
  online, recovered)
- **Recovery script**: Optionally execute a script when failure threshold
  is reached
- **Diagnostics**: Downloadable diagnostics file for troubleshooting
- All changes apply immediately without Home Assistant restart

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer
- Tasmota firmware with NeoPool support
  ([Documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/NeoPool/))
- MQTT broker configured in Home Assistant

## Installation through HACS

This integration is available as a custom repository in [HACS].

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
1. Click on "Integrations"
1. Click the three dots menu → "Custom repositories"
1. Add `https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sugar-valley-neopool` with category
   "Integration"
1. Search for "Sugar Valley NeoPool" and install
1. Restart Home Assistant

## Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from
   [GitHub](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-sugar-valley-neopool/releases)
1. Extract and copy `custom_components/sugar_valley_neopool` to your
   `config/custom_components/` directory
1. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
1. Click **Add Integration**
1. Search for "Sugar Valley NeoPool"
1. Enter:
   - **Device Name**: A friendly name for your pool controller
   - **Tasmota Device Topic**: The MQTT topic used by your Tasmota device
     (e.g., `SmartPool`)

The integration also supports **automatic MQTT discovery** - if your Tasmota
device is publishing NeoPool data, it may be discovered automatically.

### Runtime Options

After installation, you can adjust runtime settings without restart:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Sugar Valley NeoPool**
1. Click **Configure** to open the options dialog
1. Adjust the available options:
   - **Recovery script**: Script to execute when failure threshold is reached
   - **Enable repair notifications**: Toggle repair issue creation on/off
   - **Failures threshold**: Number of consecutive LWT offline messages before
     triggering notifications (1-10)
   - **Offline timeout**: How long the device must be offline before triggering
     notifications (60-3600 seconds)
1. Click **Submit** - changes apply immediately

### Reconfiguring Connection Settings

To change the device name or MQTT topic:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Sugar Valley NeoPool**
1. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) on the integration card
1. Select **Reconfigure**
1. Update the settings and click **Submit**

Note: Entity IDs are based on the device NodeID, so changing the device name
or topic will not affect your historical data or automations.

## Migration from YAML Package

If you're currently using the YAML package
([`ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml`](docs/ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml)):

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: You **MUST** remove the YAML package and restart Home
> Assistant **BEFORE** adding this integration. If you skip this step:
>
> - You will get **duplicate entities** (both YAML and integration entities)
> - Both sets will be active and receiving updates simultaneously
> - You'll need to manually clean up the mess afterward
>
> The YAML package creates entities dynamically - they won't "transfer" to the
> integration automatically. The migration deletes the old MQTT entities and
> recreates them with the same entity IDs to preserve history.

### Migration Steps

1. **Remove/comment out** the YAML package from your `configuration.yaml`
1. **Restart Home Assistant** - this is essential! After restart, the entities
   will remain in the registry with all historical data intact, but they'll be
   "orphaned" (no longer receiving updates from the YAML package)
1. **Install** this custom integration through HACS or manually (see above)
1. **Add the integration** in Home Assistant:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
   - Search for "Sugar Valley NeoPool"
   - Check the box **"I have removed the YAML package and restarted Home
     Assistant"**
1. **Auto-detection**: The integration will attempt to:
   - Auto-detect your MQTT topic (falls back to asking you if not found)
   - Auto-detect migratable entities with prefix `neopool_mqtt_`
   - Configure Tasmota with `SetOption157 1` to expose NodeID
1. **Review "What will happen"**: Before migration, you'll see:
   - Summary of validated settings (topic, NodeID)
   - List of entities to be migrated
   - Confirmation checkbox (required to proceed)
1. **Review "What was done"**: After confirming, you'll see:
   - Number of entities processed and migrated
   - List of migrated entities
   - Any errors that occurred
1. **Final verification**: After setup completes, check the **persistent
   notification** for the final assessment:
   - ✅ **Migration Successful**: History was verified and preserved
   - ⚠️ **Partially Successful**: Some entities verified, some could not be
   - ℹ️ **Complete (No History)**: Migration done but no old history to verify
   - ❌ **Verification Failed**: Check errors in notification

### How History Preservation Works

The migration process preserves your historical data by:

1. **Finding** your old MQTT entities by their `unique_id` prefix
1. **Extracting** the actual `entity_id` from each entity (handles custom names)
1. **Deleting** the old MQTT entities from the entity registry
1. **Creating** new entities with the **same `entity_id`** as the deleted ones
1. **Verifying** that historical data (older than 1 hour) is accessible

Since Home Assistant's recorder indexes history by `entity_id`, your graphs,
statistics, and long-term data are preserved when the new entity uses the
same `entity_id` as the old one.

### Why NodeID?

The integration uses the hardware NodeID from your NeoPool controller to
create stable unique identifiers:

- **Pattern**: `neopool_mqtt_{nodeid}_{entity_key}`
- **Example**: `neopool_mqtt_ABC123_water_temperature`
- **Benefits**:
  - Stable IDs that survive MQTT topic changes
  - Support for multiple NeoPool controllers without conflicts
  - Hardware-based identification instead of software configuration

### Troubleshooting Migration

**Problem**: "Cannot read from this MQTT topic"

- Verify your Tasmota device is online and publishing to the topic you entered
- Check the topic name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify MQTT broker is working: look for `tele/{topic}/SENSOR` messages

**Problem**: "No migratable entities found"

- Verify entities with the `neopool_mqtt_` prefix exist in your entity registry
- Entities already owned by this integration cannot be migrated again
- If you used a custom `unique_id` prefix in your YAML package, you'll be
  prompted to enter it. To find your prefix:
  1. Go to **Developer Tools** → **States**
  2. Find any NeoPool entity (e.g., `sensor.neopool_water_temperature`)
  3. Click on it and look at the **Entity ID** attribute
  4. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities** tab
  5. Search for the entity and click the gear icon to see its **Unique ID**
  6. The prefix is everything before the entity key (e.g., if unique_id is
     `my_pool_water_temperature`, the prefix is `my_pool_`)

**Problem**: "Failed to configure NodeID"

- Manually set `SetOption157 1` in Tasmota console, then retry setup
- Some Tasmota versions may require this to be set manually

**Problem**: Entities appear duplicated

- This happens if you didn't remove the YAML package before adding the
  integration. The YAML package creates entities dynamically via MQTT, so:
  - The old YAML entities continue to receive updates (active)
  - The new integration creates its own entities with the migrated unique_ids
  - Both sets of entities appear and update simultaneously
- **To fix**:
  1. Remove/comment out the YAML package from `configuration.yaml`
  2. Restart Home Assistant
  3. The YAML-created entities will become unavailable
  4. You may need to manually delete the orphaned entities from
     **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities** tab
- **Prevention**: Always remove the YAML package and restart HA **before**
  running the migration wizard

## Device Triggers

The integration provides device triggers that allow you to create automations
based on device connection events.

### Available Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Device offline** | Fires when the device goes offline (MQTT LWT) |
| **Device online** | Fires when the device comes back online |
| **Device recovered** | Fires when the device recovers after extended outage |

### How to Use Device Triggers

1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation**
1. Click **Add Trigger** and select **Device**
1. Select your NeoPool device
1. Choose from the available triggers

### Device Trigger Automation Example

Get notified when your NeoPool device goes offline and comes back online:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "NeoPool Device Offline Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: device
        domain: sugar_valley_neopool
        device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
        type: device_offline
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "NeoPool Offline"
          message: "The NeoPool device is unreachable. Check Tasmota device."

  - alias: "NeoPool Device Recovered"
    trigger:
      - platform: device
        domain: sugar_valley_neopool
        device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
        type: device_recovered
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "NeoPool Online"
          message: "The NeoPool device is back online and responding."
```

## Recovery Script

You can configure a Home Assistant script to run automatically when the
device has been offline for the configured threshold. This is useful for
automated recovery actions.

### Configuration

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Sugar Valley NeoPool**
1. Click **Configure** to open the options dialog
1. Select a script from the **Recovery script** dropdown
1. The script will run when the failure threshold is reached

### Recovery Script Variables

When the recovery script runs, it receives context variables that you can use
in your script actions. Access these using the `trigger` context:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `device_name` | The configured device name | `"Pool Controller"` |
| `mqtt_topic` | The MQTT topic for the device | `"SmartPool"` |
| `nodeid` | The device's hardware NodeID | `"ABC123"` |
| `failures_count` | Number of consecutive failures | `3` |

### Example Recovery Script

Create a script that restarts a smart plug and sends a notification with
device details:

```yaml
script:
  neopool_recovery:
    alias: "NeoPool Recovery Script"
    sequence:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "NeoPool Recovery"
          message: >
            {{ device_name }} failed {{ failures_count }} times.
            MQTT topic: {{ mqtt_topic }}. Restarting power...
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.tasmota_smart_plug
      - delay:
          seconds: 10
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.tasmota_smart_plug
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "NeoPool Recovery Complete"
          message: "Power cycled for {{ device_name }} (NodeID: {{ nodeid }})"
```

## MQTT Topic Configuration

In your Tasmota device, the MQTT topic is configured under
**Configuration** → **Configure MQTT** → **Topic**.

The integration expects MQTT messages on these topics:

- `tele/{topic}/SENSOR` - Sensor data (JSON)
- `tele/{topic}/LWT` - Last Will and Testament (Online/Offline)
- `cmnd/{topic}/{command}` - Commands

## Tasmota NeoPool Setup

For detailed Tasmota NeoPool setup instructions, see the
[official documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/NeoPool/).

### Recommended Tasmota Configuration

```console
# Enable NeoPool telemetry
NPTelePeriod 60

# Enable all data in telemetry
NPResult 2

# Enable NodeID exposure (required for this integration)
SetOption157 1
```

## Known Limitations

- **Single device per integration**: Each config entry supports one NeoPool
  device. To monitor multiple devices, add the integration multiple times
- **Tasmota firmware required**: The integration communicates via MQTT
  with Tasmota; direct RS485/Modbus is not supported
- **Push-based updates**: Data is received via MQTT push; frequency depends
  on your `NPTelePeriod` setting

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.sugar_valley_neopool: debug
```

### View and Download Diagnostics

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Sugar Valley NeoPool**
1. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) on the integration card
1. Select **Download diagnostics**

The diagnostic file contains sanitized device information and configuration.
Sensitive data like NodeID and MQTT topics are automatically redacted.

### Common Issues

1. **Entities show as unavailable**

   - Check that your Tasmota device is online and publishing to MQTT
   - Verify the MQTT topic matches your configuration
   - Check the LWT topic shows "Online"

1. **Commands not working**

   - Ensure the Tasmota device has write access to NeoPool
   - Check MQTT broker permissions
