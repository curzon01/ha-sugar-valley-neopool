Home Assistant custom integration for **Sugar Valley NeoPool** controllers connected via **Tasmota MQTT**.

## Features

This integration provides comprehensive monitoring and control of your NeoPool system:

### Sensors

- **Water Temperature** - Current pool water temperature
- **pH** - pH level, state, and pump status
- **Redox (ORP)** - Oxidation-reduction potential
- **Hydrolysis** - Chlorine production level, state, and runtime statistics
- **Filtration** - Mode and speed
- **Powerunit** - Voltage diagnostics (5V, 12V, 24-30V, 4-20mA)
- **Connection** - Modbus communication statistics

### Binary Sensors

- Module presence (pH, Redox, Hydrolysis, Chlorine, Conductivity, Ionization)
- Relay states (pH, Filtration, Light, Acid)
- Water flow and tank level indicators

### Controls

- **Switches** - Filtration, Light, AUX1-AUX4 relays
- **Selects** - Filtration mode/speed, Boost mode
- **Numbers** - pH Min/Max, Redox setpoint, Hydrolysis setpoint
- **Buttons** - Clear error state

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer
- Tasmota firmware with NeoPool support ([Documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/NeoPool/))
- MQTT broker configured in Home Assistant

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
1. Click on "Integrations"
1. Click the three dots menu → "Custom repositories"
1. Add `https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-neopool-mqtt` with category "Integration"
1. Search for "Sugar Valley NeoPool" and install
1. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/alexdelprete/ha-neopool-mqtt/releases)
1. Extract and copy `custom_components/sugar_valley_neopool` to your `config/custom_components/` directory
1. Restart Home Assistant

### Migration from YAML Package

If you're currently using the YAML package
([`ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml`](docs/ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml)):

> ⚠️ **Important**: You must remove the YAML package **before** adding this integration to avoid
> duplicate entities.

1. **Remove/comment out** the YAML package from your `configuration.yaml`
1. **Restart Home Assistant** - entities will become "orphaned" but remain in the registry
   with all historical data intact
1. **Install** this custom integration through HACS or manually (see above)
1. **Add the integration** in Home Assistant:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
   - Search for "Sugar Valley NeoPool"
   - Check the box **"Migrating from YAML package"**
1. **Auto-detection**: The integration will attempt to:
   - Auto-detect your MQTT topic (falls back to asking you if not found)
   - Auto-detect orphaned entities with prefix `neopool_mqtt_` (falls back to asking for
     custom prefix)
   - Configure Tasmota with `SetOption157 1` to expose NodeID
1. **Review and confirm**: Before migration, you'll see:
   - Summary of validated settings (topic, NodeID)
   - List of entities to be migrated
   - Explanation of what will happen
   - Confirmation checkbox (required to proceed)
1. **Verify migration**:
   - Check the persistent notification for migration results
   - All your entities should appear in the new integration
   - Historical data should be intact (graphs show continuous data)
   - Test that controls (switches, selects, numbers) work correctly

#### Why NodeID?

The integration now uses the hardware NodeID from your NeoPool controller to create stable unique identifiers:

- **Pattern**: `neopool_mqtt_{nodeid}_{entity_key}`
- **Example**: `neopool_mqtt_ABC123_water_temperature`
- **Benefits**:
  - Stable IDs that survive MQTT topic changes
  - Support for multiple NeoPool controllers without conflicts
  - Hardware-based identification instead of software configuration

#### Troubleshooting Migration

**Problem**: "Cannot read from this MQTT topic"

- Verify your Tasmota device is online and publishing to the topic you entered
- Check the topic name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify MQTT broker is working: look for `tele/{topic}/SENSOR` messages

**Problem**: "No orphaned entities found"

- Make sure you removed the YAML package from `configuration.yaml`
- Make sure you restarted Home Assistant after removing the YAML package
- If you used a custom `unique_id` prefix, enter it when prompted

**Problem**: "Failed to configure NodeID"

- Manually set `SetOption157 1` in Tasmota console, then retry setup
- Some Tasmota versions may require this to be set manually

**Problem**: Entities appear duplicated

- This happens if you didn't remove the YAML package before adding the integration
- Remove the YAML package from `configuration.yaml` and restart Home Assistant
- The duplicates should be resolved after restart

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
1. Click **Add Integration**
1. Search for "Sugar Valley NeoPool"
1. Enter:
   - **Device Name**: A friendly name for your pool controller
   - **Tasmota Device Topic**: The MQTT topic used by your Tasmota device (e.g., `SmartPool`)

The integration also supports **automatic MQTT discovery** - if your Tasmota device is
publishing NeoPool data, it may be discovered automatically.

## MQTT Topic Configuration

In your Tasmota device, the MQTT topic is configured under **Configuration** → **Configure MQTT** → **Topic**.

The integration expects MQTT messages on these topics:

- `tele/{topic}/SENSOR` - Sensor data (JSON)
- `tele/{topic}/LWT` - Last Will and Testament (Online/Offline)
- `cmnd/{topic}/{command}` - Commands

## Tasmota NeoPool Setup

For detailed Tasmota NeoPool setup instructions, see the [official documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/NeoPool/).

### Recommended Tasmota Configuration

```console
# Enable NeoPool telemetry
NPTelePeriod 60

# Enable all data in telemetry
NPResult 2
```

## Removal

To remove this integration from Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
1. Find the "Sugar Valley NeoPool" integration
1. Click the three dots menu (⋮) next to it
1. Select **Delete**
1. Confirm the deletion

This will remove the integration, all associated devices, and entities from Home Assistant.
Your Tasmota device and MQTT broker configuration will remain unchanged.

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.sugar_valley_neopool: debug
```

### Common Issues

1. **Entities show as unavailable**

   - Check that your Tasmota device is online and publishing to MQTT
   - Verify the MQTT topic matches your configuration
   - Check the LWT topic shows "Online"

1. **Commands not working**

   - Ensure the Tasmota device has write access to NeoPool
   - Check MQTT broker permissions
